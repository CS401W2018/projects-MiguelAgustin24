    <p>President Nelson said: </p>
    <blockquote><i>“The source of our <strong>spiritual power</strong> is the Lord! 
        The <mark>ultimate source of spiritual power</mark> is God our Father. 
        The messenger of this power is the Holy Ghost. 
        This power differs from electrical power. 
        An electrical appliance consumes power. 
        The use of His spiritual power replenishes our power.” 
        </i><b>(“Protect the Spiritual Power Line,” October 1984)</b></blockquote>

        for one another and the concept of Hawaiian aloha are one and the same. 
        You come to this community that’s been based on that <em>aloha spirit.</em> </blockquote>
