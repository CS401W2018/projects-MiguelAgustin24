    <h1>Aloha! My name is Miguel Agustin.</h1>
    <hr>
    <h2>Get to know me:</h2>
    <p>Aloha! I was born at Quezon City, Philippines on March 24, 2000. I have two siblings, and I am the youngest of them. I grew in the church, and I got baptized when i was 8 years old. When I was a kid I always wanted to become a chef, 
        because even at my young age I am trying to assist my mom whenever she cooks. But as time goes by, I realized i wanted to become like my father, who works in an airline company. 
        However, when i finished my high school, I told my parents i want to pursue architecture, since i am passionate when it comes in drawing or skteching. 
        After my mission, my perspective in life changed.
        I thought to myself i want to have a family, i want to get married in the temple as soon as possible. 
        But God has a different plan for me and He wants me to focus more on developing my Christ-like attributes. Afterwards, I did try my best on following that plan and after two years, God gave me a fine woman who turned out to be my wife, after 1 and a half years of dating. 
    </p>
    <br><p>Furthermore, as I trust more in God's plan, He sent me here in BYU-Hawaii, and now, I am pursuing Computer Science as my major. 
        I realized that in this life, there are a lot of things that we want, but as we grow old, there will be some opportunities that we must grab 
        because we may never know that it may be the answer to our life's question. Moving on to my interest, there are some fun interests that i would like to share
        in my page. I am music lover, i like listening to pop music such as Michael Jackson, Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, an so much more. 
        I also love dogs and cats, back in the Philippines i have those kinds of pets and i like hanging out with them. Lastly, I like playing
        video games and i will show you my ranking which games, for me, is the best.
