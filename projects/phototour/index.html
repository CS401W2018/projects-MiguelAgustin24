            This is a photo tour of the Philippines! I hope you will enjoy as you explore the wonders of my beautiful country. I chose this amazing places since they hold dear to my childhood experiences. 
            One of the places that you are about to explore is Bacolod, Bacolod is where i served my mission back in 2018-2020. I really love that place, the people
            and the food. According to tourist, Bacolod has been identified as the "City of Smiles", and i can really testify of that since everywhere i go i always see happy people despite of the challenges they face.
            I hope you enjoy this simple Photo tour! Thanks for visiting!
