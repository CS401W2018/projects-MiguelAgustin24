            The Team:
        </span>
        </h2>
        <h2>
            Iron Man:
        </h2>
        <p class="second">
            Iron Man or <span class = "black">Tony Stark</span> is a super smart billionaire who built a high-tech suit of armor to fight against bad guys.
            Even though he's a genius, he's kind of arrogant but has a good heart deep down. Tony is willing to sacrifice his life to defend the 
            earth in order to protect the people from the forces of evil.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Captain America:
        </h2>
        <p class="third">Captain America or Steve Rogers is a super-soldier from World War II, he's got enhanced strength and always does what's right.
            He's the leader of the Avengers and has an unbreakable shield that is made from vibranium.</p>
        <h2>
            The Hulk:
        </h2>
        <p class="fourth">When Bruce gets angry, he turns into the huge, green, unstoppable Hulk. 
            He's super strong but sometimes he struggles with controlling his emotions and powers. He got his super strength after being exposed to gamma-radiation, therefore, he turned into a mean monster 
            that became a hero to the people. </p>
        <h2>
            Hawkeye:
        </h2>
        <p class="fifth">Clint Barton or the Hawkeye is a master archer who rarely misses a shot. 
            Clint doesn't have superpowers, but he's super brave and a key part of the team. I really like how he inspires the people because he is just a norma human being,just like us, but 
        because of his desire to help, he then become a hero to all.</p>
        <h2>
            Thor Odinson:
        </h2>
        <p class="sixth">Thor is the god of thunder from Asgard, with a magical hammer that only he can lift, because of his "WORTHINESS". 
            He's strong, very powerful, and is a bit of a joker, but he's loyal to his friends. He has a brother named Loki, the god of mischeif, and they both had a long-term disagreement with each other,
            but as time goes by, they both became good brothers and they helped each other from time to time.
        <h2>
            Black Widow:
            
        </h2>
    
        <p class="seventh">The Black Widow is a highly skilled spy with amazing combat skills, even without superpowers. 
            Natasha is tough, smart, and always gets the job done. Natasha has a tough back story before she became part of the Avengers, but she managed to pull through with the help of her family.</p>
