            <span class = "black">Tony Stark </span>is my awesome hero, he wears an awesome armored suits that protects him from blasts and explosions.
            What amazes me even more is that he upgrades those suits every now and then, and in Avengers: Endgame he now wears a nano-tech suit, THAT IS SO AMAZING! I've been a fan of him since 2009, during his first Iron Man movie, because he inspires me with his brilliance and bravery. 
            One unforgettable moment that he had shown is how he is willing to sacrifice himself to use the six infinity stones to defeat Thanos. Even though he died, his legacy still remains.
