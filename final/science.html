            Science is the study of the natural world through observation and experiments. It helps us understand how things work and why they happen. For example, scientists study the stars and planets in space, the animals and plants on Earth, and even the tiny cells that make up our bodies. Science is all about asking questions, making discoveries, and learning new things!

They have roots that anchor them in the ground, a trunk that supports their branches, and leaves that capture sunlight and turn it into food. Trees provide shade, shelter, and food for animals, and they help clean the air we breathe.
