                <p>
                    The title of my site is "Bright Minds Academy" and the topic of my site is about Kids Educational Website.

                <b>The purpose of your site.</b>
                <p>
                    The purpose of my site is to provide a platform for kids to learn and have fun at the same time. 
                    I chose this topic because when we say something related to kids, it is colorful, a lot of images, 
                    and easy to interact with. When I was creating past projects, I notice that most of my websites are colorful, 
                    and I think I can easily look for some non-copyright images for kids, because I know there will be a lot of them. 
                    I also realized that I can make some fun simple games to kids to play with. And lastly, I am expecting a daughter this month and I would like her in 
                    the future to come and visit my website. </p>

                        Math Page – it will tell them about math, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I am hoping that I can make some simple math problems. So I am going to insert a table in this page, specifically for multiplication table
